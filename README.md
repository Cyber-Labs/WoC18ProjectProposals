### Style Transfer on Image (For second years) (Demo, Paper)
Ever wished you could paint like Picasso or Van Gogh? Now, it is possible for a Deep Learning enthusiast like you by using the art of Neural Style Transfer. Style transfer is the technique of recomposing images in the style of other images. In this project, we will implement “A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style” by Leon A. Gatys et al. 
Requirements:
1. Conceptual knowledge of Deep Learning and specifically Convolutional Neural Networks.
2. Strong programming skills in Python and knowledge of a Deep Learning framework (Tensorflow/ Keras/ PyTorch) is preferred.

### Newsroom
- #### Description
1. An android app which fetches the posts from Facebook pages of various student clubs(Cyber Labs, Manthan, Mailer Daemon etc), student chapters(E.g. ACM Student chapter, ASME Student Chapter etc.), departmental societies(E.g. SIAM - Maths Dept, CSES - CSE Dept. etc.) and from other miscellaneous pages like SCG(Student Coordination Group), ISS(ISM Students’ Society) etc. 
Each of the student clubs, student chapters, departmental societies, and other miscellanous groups can register on the app as an ENTITY(coin a better term for this).

2. Each ENTITY must have a facebook page. A separate channel will be created in the Android app for each ENTITY. 

3. Whenever a new post comes on an ENTITY’s fb page, it will also show up in the channel of the ENTITY in the newsroom app. This can be done by Facebook Graph API.  


4. A USER (student/faculty) can register as a user and can subscribe to the Channel he/she wants to see the fb posts of. Every time a subscribed channel has a new post, a suitable notification should come on the USER’s android phone. 

### Shared Calender
- #### Description
 Shared calendar is an android app to solve the problem of clashes of student activities in college. 

- #### Version 1 goals:
 A calendar screen which is readable by every user and editable by the coordinator of every club/student chapter (or by 1 or 2 fixed persons per club/student chapter).  E.g. Cyberlabs is organizing a workshop on some day. So, cyberlabs will highlight the timeframe on the calendar for the day it is organizing a workshop. 

- #### Version 2 goals (Requires ISM admin to align on this): 
 Include each hall and auditorium etc like GJLT, Penman, Seminar Hall, Management Hall etc and make accounts for these rooms too(Can also consider NLHC rooms if feasible from admin’s end). Then the admin person who is responsible for maintaining record of the fact that whether a particular hall under his responsibility is booked for a timeslot or not, can mark the timeframe in the calendar when the hall under his responsibility is booked, along with the reason for which it is booked. In this way, entire college can see by sitting in the room itself whether a particular hall is booked or not. 

### Bookmark Manager Web extension (For second, first years)
 A web extension which is used to manage bookmarks having these features (but not limited to):-
  The user can search in bookmarks (for the title, URL) (Implement fuzzy search)
User can save notes along with bookmarks for future references.
Users can export all the data (including notes) to a separate json file.
Requirements:
Basic knowledge of HTML,CSS,JavaScript
